# Personal-projects

Projects I've worked on in my free time, mostly to better understand something by re-implementing it.

### 3D :
Tried to better understand how 3D graphics work and projective geometry by re-implementing some basic functions, like rotating a cube in front of a camera.

### Parsers :
Re-implemented an [LR0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser) (bottom-up) parser, with the goal of understanding better how it works and what are its limitations when defining a language in [BN form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form).
The goal was to also implement LR(1) and LALR parsers which are similar. For practical uses, [Lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark) is great.
